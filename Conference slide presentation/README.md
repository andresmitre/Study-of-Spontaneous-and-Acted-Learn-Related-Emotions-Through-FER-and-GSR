## Metropolis


**IMPORTANT NOTICES FOR VERSION 1.0**

* The package and theme name changed from *m* to *metropolis*!
* The `title format` values have been restructured. Please refer to the
  [manual][].

---

Metropolis is a simple, modern Beamer theme suitable for anyone to use. It tries
to minimize noise and maximize space for content; the only visual flourish it
offers is an (optional) progress bar added to each slide. The core design
principles of the theme were described in a blog post
[here](http://bloerg.net/2014/09/20/a-modern-beamer-theme.html).

## Installation

Installing Metropolis from source, like any Beamer theme, involves four easy
steps:

1. **Download the source** with a `git clone` of the [Metropolis repository](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) or as a [zip archive](https://github.com/matze/mtheme/archive/master.zip) of the latest development version.

2. **Compile the style files** by running `make sty` inside the downloaded
    directory. (Or run LaTeX directly on `source/metropolistheme.ins`.)

3. **Move the resulting `*.sty` files** to the folder containing your
   presentation. To use Metropolis with many presentations, run `make install`
   or move the `*.sty` files to a folder in your TeX path instead (might require
   `sudo` rights).

4. **Use the theme for your presentation** by declaring `\usetheme{metropolis}` in
    the preamble of your Beamer document.


## Usage

The following code shows a minimal example of a Beamer presentation using
Metropolis.

```latex
\documentclass{beamer}
\usetheme{metropolis}           % Use metropolis theme
\title{A minimal example}
\date{\today}
\author{Matthias Vogelgesang}
\institute{Centre for Modern Beamer Themes}
\begin{document}
  \maketitle
  \section{First Section}
  \begin{frame}{First Frame}
    Hello, world!
  \end{frame}
\end{document}
```

Detailed information on using Metropolis can be found in the [manual][].
