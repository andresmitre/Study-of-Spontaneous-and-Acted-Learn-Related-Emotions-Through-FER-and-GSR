   "The objective of this work, is the reliable recognition of spontaneous and acted emotions related with learning activities through a classificatory off facial expressions and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). The induction of spontaneous emotions, were generated by clips from movies that showed a good capacity to induce positive and negative effects, elevated levels of emotional activation and variations in the perception of emotional control. On the other hand, the emotions performed were replicated by the participants imitating a sequence of illustrations referencing the emotions. The classificatory was applied to 23 participants of Hispanic ethnic, participants were told a series of instructions. The experiments in this work were based in emotion classification by facial expressions through a Convolutional Neural Network and Galvanic Skin Response. Once, obtained the raw data of the experiment, it processed to the training of classificatory from deep learning and statistical analysis. The Convolutional Neural Network, presented a validation accuracy of 96.5%, a confusion matrix was made with the images of the data set at random and external data sets. In the confusion matrix of the external data set, the real emotions are confused with others, mainly in happy and boredom, correctly classifying in the stress. In the results of Galvanic Skin Response, percentage change tests were performed between the emotions in which significant different were found in happy and boredom, except in stress. With the support of the Neuronal Convolutional Network and Galvanic Skin Activity, it is possible to have a correct classifier of emotions related to learning activities."

    "# What is Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    " “Deep learning methods are representation-learning methods with multiple levels of representation, obtained by composing simple but nonlinear modules that each transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a represen- tation at a higher, slightly more abstract level. [. . . ] The key aspect of deep learning is that these layers are not designed by human engineers: they are learned from data using a general-purpose learning procedure [[1]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "As  regards  machines,  we  might  say,  very  broadly,  that  a  machine  learns whenever it changes its structure, program, or data (based on its inputs or in response  to  external  information)  in  such  a  manner  that  its  expected  future performance improves.  Some of these changes, such as the addition of a record to a data base, fall comfortably within the province of other disciplines and are not necessarily better understood for being called learning.  But, for example, when the performance of a speech-recognition machine improves after hearing several samples of a person’s speech, we feel quite justified in that case to say that the machine has learned. Machine learning usually refers to the changes in systems that perform tasks associated with artificial intelligence (AI). Such tasks involve recognition, diagnosis, planning, robot control, prediction, etc.  The “changes” might be either enhancements to already performing systems orab initio synthesis of new systems [[2]](http://robotics.stanford.edu/~nilsson/MLBOOK.pdf).\n",
